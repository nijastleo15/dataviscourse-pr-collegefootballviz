Peer Feedback - CS 6630 Visualization for Data Science
10/30/2018

* Names in group that gave us feedback:
- Haihan Lin
- Xuan Huang


* Their feedback:

They thought it was a solid plan!

They suggested comparing two/mulitple selected schools on the profile
table and line chart. This could be done by showing the differences
between revenues/expenses/etc. between the two schools on the profile 
table. Multiple schools could be superimposed on the same line graph.

We could also color code map circles by conference, or highlight them
in some way. For example, if "Big Ten" was selected for a conference,
those circles could get darker/bigger while the other circles got
lighter/smaller.

In addition to categorical variables like conference, we could also color
code schools by quantitative variables such as revenue. We could create a
color scale that shows schools with higher revenue as darker, for example.
These colors could be shown on the map, the scatter plot, or both.


* What we will do based on their feedback:

    Their suggestions touched on a lot of the optional features that we
had in mind. Our focus will be implementing our must-haves, then adding
to them using our original ideas for optional features as well as the
suggestions from the other group. Haihan and Xuan definitely gave us some
good ideas on ways to "spice up" the look of our visualization.
